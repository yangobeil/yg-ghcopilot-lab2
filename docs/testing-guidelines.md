Unit tests: Use Jest to test individual functions and React components in isolation
Unit tests should use the naming convention *.test.js or *.test.ts
Backend unit tests should be placed in packages/backend/__tests__/ directory
Frontend unit tests should be placed in packages/frontend/src/__tests__/ directory
Name unit test files to match what they're testing (e.g., app.test.js for testing app.js)
Integration tests: Use Jest + Supertest to test backend API endpoints with real HTTP requests
Integration tests should be placed in packages/backend/__tests__/integration/ directory
Integration tests should also use the naming convention *.test.js or *.test.ts
Name integration test files intelligently based on what they test (e.g., todos-api.test.js for TODO API endpoints)
End-to-end (E2E) tests: Use Playwright (the required framework) to test complete UI workflows through browser automation
E2E tests should be placed in tests/e2e/ directory
E2E tests should use the naming convention *.spec.js or *.spec.ts
Name E2E test files based on the user journey they test (e.g., todo-workflow.spec.js)
Port Configuration: Always use environment variables with sensible defaults for port configuration
Backend: const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3030;
Frontend: React's default port is 3000, but can be overridden with PORT environment variable
This allows CI/CD workflows to dynamically detect ports
Playwright tests must use one browser only
Playwright tests must use the Page Object Model (POM) pattern for maintainability
Limit E2E tests to 5-8 critical user journeys - focus on happy paths and key edge cases, not exhaustive coverage
All tests must be isolated and independent - each test should set up its own data and not rely on other tests
Setup and teardown hooks are required - tests must succeed on multiple runs
Specify that all new features should include appropriate tests
Tests should be maintainable and follow best practices
